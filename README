Temp plugin for moodle; to understand all plugin files involved.

All files 'touched'

Version.php created _/

lang/en/local_mdl_tmpplugin.php created _/

lib.php created _/ - Contains only a single func (tmpfunc) which prints CFG variable. I am still yet to figure out how to add a link which when clicked will call this function, or something of that sort.

db/* - all xml files using xmldb editor. How'er for xmldb editor to detect this plugin of ours, we need to have a minimal content in settings.php and also in some more files.(which ones?)

settings.php created - using settings.php for archaius theme. Added only an item called mdl_localplugin in 'themes' section of settings.

Another question is are all the files always required? I guess no. So removing files and folders I think are useless in this small plugin. So removed jquery, yui and pix folders.

Another thing. The plagiarism folder in moodle root (to contain all plag. related plugins) has a file called lib.php, which contains only function prototypes. We need to write the functions there. So for my tmpplugin, what and where would be the prototypes???
